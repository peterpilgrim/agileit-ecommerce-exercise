# valtech-challenge-ecommerce

This was my project to answer the [Valtech](http://valtech.com] E-Commerce Challenge 2016 
 
This challenge was my answer to a Hacker Rank test, and I completed it out of curiousity.

There were two parts to the challenge.

    1. Build a shopping cart to hold an arbitrary sequence of product items. 
    There were two types items: apples and oranges. Apples cost 0.60 and Oranges cost 0.25.
    The shopping cart must accurately price all of the items in it.
    
 
    2. Extend the shopping cart to allow the business to apply *simple* offers.
    The first offer was, "buy one, get one free on Apples"
    The second offer was, "three for the price of two on Oranges"
    The shopping cart must accurately price and update accordingly.

    
It took me less than 60 minutes after I reverted all code to do with "case classes and inheritance", 
which is a feature deprecated since Scala 2.10.
